# Features

## `SUMMARY.md` generation

[mdBook][] demands a `summary.md` file at the root directory. This file serves as an index of which notes go into the rendered website, however in a large vault it can quickly turn to be cumbersome to maintain. `mdzk` solves this by reading the root of your zk and updating the summary automatically.

## Links

We support the following syntaxes for internal links:

- `[[File]]` to link to a file;
- `[[File | Title]]` to link to a file and put a custom title in-place;
- `[[File#Header]]` to link to a specific header inside a file;

## Backlinks

Support for backlinks.
