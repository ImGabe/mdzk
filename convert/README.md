This simple Python script will convert a Neuron zettelkasten into a MDZK zettelkasten. That is, it strips out the metadata section of each Neuron zettel and stores the `title` field, before copying each zettel (without the metadata) into the `root/zettels` directory of the MDZK root. Entries are then added to `SUMMARY.md`, like `[<title>](<path to note>)`, which means all notes will be accesible. If no `title` field is defined, the script will use the file basename as `title`. The script does not search recursively, so only flat zettelkasten are supported for now.

To use this on your Neuron ZK, I advise you to create a new MDZK with `mdzk init <name>` (using `mdbook init` will not work, since the book structure is different). Then you can update the script variables `NEURON_DIR` with the root of your Neuron ZK and `MDBOOK_DIR` with the root of your MDZK.
